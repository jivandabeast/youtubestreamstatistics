# YouTube Stream Statistics 

A bash script useful for gathering data from YouTube streams, specifically current live stream viewers. 

# Dependencies

The script is very minimalistic and depends on a few packages (some which should have shipped with your operating system):
* `curl` 
* `date`
* `jq`

Obviously, if you plan on using the mySQL version of the script then you will require mySQL (`mysql-server`)
